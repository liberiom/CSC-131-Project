# CSC-131-Project

This is the CSC 131 Project made by The Syntax Errors. It was planned and created throughout the Spring 2022 semester at California State University, Sacramento.

# Rules:

1. There are numbers in the table which range from 1 to 8.
2. The goal of the game is to find 2 pairs of the same number.
3. You can only select between 1 to 4 for both the row and the column!
